# MiniProjects
A compilation of miniature projects, mainly in Java and C. Through these mini-projects, I have allowed myself to improve my programming skills in GUI Design, Network Programming, Multi-threading, and more

The mini-projects in this repository include:
(1) Conway's Game of Life Simulator (using Java Swing GUI)
(2) Network Programmed 2 player BattleShip (using Java)
(3) Network Programmed 32-user chat server (using C)
(4) Multi-threaded solution to the Knights Tour Problem for an n x n board (using C)
(5) Multi-threaded Conway's Game of Life Simulator (using Java Swing GUI)
